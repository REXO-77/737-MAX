# 737-MAX
A project to create the 737 MAX series for FlightGear, the free flight simulator.

# Installation Instructuions
- Download and unzip this folder in your aircraft folder. Make sure FlightGear is pointed to that folder; if not, you can tell it to do so in the Add-Ons menu.
- Make sure to remove the '-main' from the end of the folder, or it won't work.
- The aircraft should now show up in the launcher.

*Progress is underway!* If you have any questions, feel free to email me at sriemmanuel787@outlook.com or contact me on the FG Discord with the usename 'naviat' Thanks!
